# Minishell42

A small and simple shell inspired by Bash, but with significantly fewer features.

## Description

This project involved creating our own shell with specific required functionalities, using Bash as a reference. While it doesnâ€™t fully replicate Bash, it implements many of its core features.

Minishell may lack the extensive capabilities of Bash, but it includes essential functionalities such as syntax error detection, command execution, input/output redirection, and piping. Additionally, it provides basic support for environment variables on a smaller scale.
